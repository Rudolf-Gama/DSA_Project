# Hyderabad Metro Stations - DSA Project

## Project Overview

This project is a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementation focused on the Hyderabad Metro system. It uses various algorithms to analyze and manage routes between metro stations, including finding distances, calculating costs, and listing stations. The project showcases the use of graph theory, specifically Dijkstra's algorithm, to solve real-world problems related to metro transit systems.

## Features

- **Metro Stations List**: Display a list of all metro stations in Hyderabad.
- **Single Source to Single Destination**: Find the shortest path and distance between a single source station and a destination station.
- **Single Source to Multiple Destinations**: Calculate the shortest paths from a single source to multiple destination stations.
- **Number of Stations Between Source and Destination**: Count the number of stations between a given source and destination.
- **Number of Stations Between Source and All Stations**: Count the number of stations between a given source and all other stations.
- **Cost Calculation**: Calculate the travel cost based on the distance between stations.

## Files

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and the interactive menu for users.
- `functions.c`: Implements various functions for calculating routes, distances, and costs.
