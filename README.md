# 🚇 Hyderabad Metro Stations - DSA Project

## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Hyderabad Metro Stations - DSA Project**! This project dives into the complexities of the Hyderabad Metro system through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). By leveraging advanced algorithms and graph theory, including Dijkstra's algorithm, this project manages and analyzes routes, calculates travel costs, and provides valuable insights into the metro network.

## ✨ Features

- 🗺️ **Metro Stations List**: View a comprehensive list of all metro stations in Hyderabad at your fingertips.
- 🚉 **Single Source to Single Destination**: Find the shortest path and distance between any two metro stations.
- 🌐 **Single Source to Multiple Destinations**: Compute the shortest paths from a single source to multiple destination stations efficiently.
- 📏 **Stations Count Between Source and Destination**: Determine the number of stations between a specified source and destination.
- 🔍 **Stations Count Between Source and All Stations**: Calculate the number of stations between a source and all other stations in the network.
- 💰 **Cost Calculation**: Estimate travel costs based on distances between stations for better planning.

## 📁 Files

- **`main.c`**: Contains the main function and interactive menu for user interactions.
- **`functions.c`**: Implements core functions for calculating routes, distances, and costs.
- **`functions.h`**: Header file with function prototypes and constants used in `functions.c`.
